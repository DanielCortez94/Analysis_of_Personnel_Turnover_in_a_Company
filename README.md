# PROJECT: Analysis of Personnel Turnover in a Company
ðŸ“‹ Project Summary
INTRODUCTION
This project aims to analyze personnel turnover in a company, in order to identify patterns and trends that can help improve employee retention.

METHODOLOGY
A data set was used that includes information about the company's employees, such as age, gender, position, joining date, and leaving date. Data analysis techniques, such as descriptive statistics and data visualization, were applied to identify patterns and trends in employee turnover.

ðŸŽ¯ FOCUSING
To address these points, a structured approach is proposed with the following phases:

ðŸ’¡ Analysis:
Collect relevant data on each point through surveys, interviews, historical data analysis and benchmarking with other companies. Identify the root causes of employee turnover, employee dissatisfaction, compensation and benefits inefficiencies, diversity and equity gaps, and obstacles to organizational performance.

Strategy development:
Design specific strategies to address each point, based on the previous analysis. These strategies may include: Employee retention programs, such as career development plans, recognition programs, and improving work-life balance. Initiatives to improve employee satisfaction, such as work environment surveys, effective communication channels and wellness programs. Reviews and adjustments in compensation and benefits systems to ensure equity and competitiveness. Implementation of policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization. Strategies to improve organizational performance, such as defining clear objectives, improving internal communication and optimizing processes.

Implementation:
Implement the developed strategies, ensuring communication and commitment at all levels of the organization. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the progress and impact of implemented strategies.

This approach will allow challenges to be addressed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner, creating a positive and productive work environment that drives the success of the organization. I hope this introduction and approach will be useful to you to start your project.
